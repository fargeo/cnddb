The occurrence instance records csv file is over 300MB.

Because of this, it could not be pushed to github without compression.

If you do not need the full occurrence data set, a partial data set is available in the package.

However, if you want to load the complete dataset, you can unzip `pkg//business_data/Occurrences.zip` and overwrite the current Occurrences.csv.
